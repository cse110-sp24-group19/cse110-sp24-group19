# Coding Monkeys Idea Pitch 

## Problem — The raw idea, a use case, or something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this
Work journals don't appeal to young adults. This might be because there is a lot of work up front and seem intimidating at the start. The younger generation can benefit from using a work journal and by making more appealing to the youth, this can help popularize it more. To make it more appealing, we aim to create a product that is convenient, intuitive, mindful, and rewarding. Additionally, we want to stimulate by making the work journal more playful and rewarding, 

Seeing the work that you have done through key progress-tracking features can be rewarding and 

This can make it a great tool for reflection and personal growth. 

## Appetite — How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
* 5-6 weeks to build a fully functional work journal
* We have a lot of cool visual feature ideas but we might need to omit some to make sure that the project can be completed in time

## Solution — The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand
* Journal Entry feature --- add, edit, delete, and search journal entries
* Calendar Widget --- links to journal entries and is populated for whatever you wrote for that day, popup, 1 entry per day is a limit
* Data Backup --- hidden folder, if you backup data, it goes to the hidden folder, can't delete unless in our webapp

* Ideas for the future:
  * Reward System --- Goal System
    * Planting a banana tree ---> user writes an entry, a banana is made ---> gold banana, sticker board and put a sticker on the board
    * Reminder Feature --- notifications, 1 week before
* At least one integration --- Slack, Github, etc.

## Rabbit holes — Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems
* Don't overcomplicate the problem
* Be careful with the reward system, can feel manipulative. Keep it controlled and not pushy. Make it motivating not manipulative.
* Focus on the base functionality first
* We need to make features accessible to a large variety of user within our target demographic


## No-gos — Anything specifically excluded from the concept: functionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t covering to fit the appetite or make the problem tractable
* Image handling
* Google calendar integration
* Latex
* Program execution
