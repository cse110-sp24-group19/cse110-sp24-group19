# Removal of Label System for Journal Entries

## Context and Problem Statement

We initially planned to implement a fixed set of default labels for journal entries in our application to help users categorize their entries more effectively. However, given our current constraints in development time and resources, we need to prioritize essential features. Introducing a label system now would stretch our limited resources too thin and could potentially delay the project.

## Considered Options

* Implement a fixed set of four default labels
* Remove the label system entirely

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Remove the label system entirely", because it simplifies development and allows us to focus on core functionalities that are critical for the launch. This decision helps manage project scope and ensures we meet our release timelines without compromising the quality of the application.
