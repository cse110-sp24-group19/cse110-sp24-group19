# Default Labels for Journal Entries

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to establish a labeling system for journal entries within our application. Initially, we considered allowing users to create an unlimited number of custom labels, offering maximum flexibility. However, this approach could make the labeling process overly complicated and harder to manage, especially given our limited development time and resources. We need a simpler solution that still provides meaningful categorization and improves the user experience.

## Considered Options

* Allow users to create unlimited custom labels
* Provide a fixed set of four default labels without customization

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: “Provide a fixed set of four default labels without customization”, because it simplifies the user experience and reduces complexity in development. This ensures a consistent and manageable labeling system, aligning with our time constraints and resource limitations. Users will not be able to add, delete, or customize these labels, maintaining simplicity and enhancing the overall user experience.
