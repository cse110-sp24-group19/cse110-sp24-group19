# Whiteboard System Implementation

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to enhance the user experience by implementing an interactive whiteboard system. This tool will allow users to sketch ideas, visualize their thoughts, and take dynamic notes within their journals. The challenge is to select the most suitable technology for implementing this whiteboard system, ensuring it is user-friendly, integrates well with the existing journal features, and provides a robust set of functionalities.

## Considered Options

* Using p5.js for the whiteboard system
* Integrating an existing whiteboard tool (e.g., Miro, Google Jamboard)
* Developing a custom whiteboard solution from scratch

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using p5.js for the whiteboard system", because this option provides a flexible and customizable solution that meets the specific needs of our users.
