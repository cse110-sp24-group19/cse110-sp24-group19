# Include Goal Setting Page in our Design

## Context and Problem Statement

As we move forward with our design we need to decide which features to implement.

## Considered Options

* Include goal setting page
* Don't include goal setting page

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Include goal setting page, because based on the discussion with our TA we needed to add more features to make our project more substantial. This is fitting for the project because it is a work journal for college students and recent grads who are Software Engineers, and goal setting can help them with their career goals. Additionally, there are options to integrate with journal entries and tasks, such as making tasks to complete a goal and linking a journal entry to a specific goal.
Here are meeting minutes for the meeting where this was discussed: https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group19/cse110-sp24-group19/blob/main/admin/meetings/051324.md
