# Calendar and Journal Integration

## Context and Problem Statement

The team has identified a need to enhance the user experience by integrating the calendar and journal views within the application. The goal is to provide a seamless interface that allows users to easily navigate between their daily journal entries and their calendar events. This integration aims to improve the usability and functionality of the app, making it more intuitive for users to track their goals and daily activities.

## Considered Options

* Integrate calendar and journal views side-by-side
* Keep calendar and journal views separate with links for navigation
* Implement a toggle switch to switch between calendar and journal views

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Integrate calendar and journal views side-by-side", because this option provides the most seamless and intuitive user experience by allowing users to see and interact with both their journal entries and calendar events simultaneously.
