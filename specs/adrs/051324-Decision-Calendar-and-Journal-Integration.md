# Calendar and Journal Integration

## Context and Problem Statement

The team has identified a need to enhance the user experience by integrating the calendar and journal views within the application. The goal is to provide a seamless interface that allows users to easily navigate between their daily journal entries and their calendar events. This integration aims to improve the usability and functionality of the app, making it more intuitive for users to track their goals and daily activities.

## Decision Drivers

* Improved user experience by providing a unified view
* Easier navigation between journal entries and calendar events
* Enhanced functionality by linking goals to journal entries
* Increased user engagement through interactive and intuitive design

## Considered Options

* Integrate calendar and journal views side-by-side
* Keep calendar and journal views separate with links for navigation
* Implement a toggle switch to switch between calendar and journal views

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Integrate calendar and journal views side-by-side", because this option provides the most seamless and intuitive user experience by allowing users to see and interact with both their journal entries and calendar events simultaneously.

### Consequences

* Good, because it improves the user experience by allowing easy access to journal entries and calendar events in one view.
* Good, because it enhances functionality by linking goals to journal entries and calendar events.
* Bad, because it may require more screen space, which could be challenging on smaller devices.
* Bad, because it may increase the complexity of the implementation.

## Validation

The integration of the calendar and journal views will be validated through user testing and feedback. We will conduct usability tests to ensure that the new layout meets user needs and enhances their experience. Additionally, we will monitor user engagement metrics to assess the impact of the integration.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Integrate calendar and journal views side-by-side

* Good, because it provides a unified view that enhances the user experience.
* Good, because it allows users to easily link goals to journal entries and calendar events.
* Neutral, because it requires careful design to ensure it works well on various screen sizes.
* Bad, because it may increase the complexity of the implementation.

### Keep calendar and journal views separate with links for navigation

* Good, because it maintains a simpler interface.
* Neutral, because it requires users to navigate between views, which could be less intuitive.
* Bad, because it does not provide the seamless experience users are looking for.
* Bad, because it may reduce user engagement with the calendar and journal features.

### Implement a toggle switch to switch between calendar and journal views

* Good, because it allows users to switch views based on their preference.
* Neutral, because it still requires users to navigate between views.
* Bad, because it may be less intuitive for users to switch back and forth frequently.
* Bad, because it does not provide the continuous, integrated experience that users may prefer.

## More Information

This decision will be revisited after initial user testing to ensure it meets the desired goals and user needs. We will collect feedback from users and make adjustments as necessary.
