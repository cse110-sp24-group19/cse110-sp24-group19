# Main Categories for Application: Journal/Calendar, Goal-Setting, and Creative Play

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to organize the features of our application into main categories to ensure a user-friendly interface and easy navigation. Initially, we considered separating journal and calendar features, but we decided to combine them into one category. The goal is to group functionalities in a way that is intuitive for users and supports their needs effectively.

## Considered Options

* Separate Journal and Calendar into individual categories
* Combine Journal and Calendar into one category
* Include Goal-Setting as a main category
* Include Creative Play as a main category

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Combine Journal and Calendar into one category, and include Goal-Setting and Creative Play as main categories," because this structure aligns with user expectations and provides a clear, organized interface. Combining Journal and Calendar leverages their interrelated use cases, while Goal-Setting and Creative Play are distinct enough to warrant their own categories.
