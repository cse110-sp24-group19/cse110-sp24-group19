# Add Reward Page to Main Categories

## Context and Problem Statement

Initially, we thought the goal-setting page would also serve the role of a rewards page. However, after starting to implement the goal-setting page, we realized a separate reward page is needed. This page would provide a consolidated view for users to track their progress and achievements over time. Without this feature, users lack a clear visual representation of their accomplishments, which is essential for motivation and continued engagement with the application.

## Considered Options

* Do nothing and keep the current functionalities as they are.
* Integrate a reward page that tracks user progress in terms of the number of journals, goals achieved, etc.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Integrate a reward page that tracks user progress in terms of the number of journals, goals achieved, etc.", because this option enhances user engagement and motivation by providing a visual representation of their achievements. This feature will be integrated directly into the main categories for ease of access and continuity within the application. The decision supports our goal of encouraging consistent use and interaction with the app.
