## Agenda:
1. Project Progress Update
2. Design Discussion and Feedback
3. Feature Clarification and Next Steps

## Decisions
Wenzhe Xu:
- Suggested adding a calendar to the main design.
- Discussed the egg/creature progression, recommending starting with a few creatures (e.g., baby dragon, teenager dragon, adult dragon).
- Proposed that each egg should randomly turn into one of three creatures upon hatching.

Julie Hong:
- Proposed adding a welcoming monkey on the main page to match the "coding monkeys" team theme.
- Suggested the monkey be separate from the reward system and appear on the main page for a better visual impact.
- Suggested that the egg growing into a creature could be moved to the goal setting or reward system page.
- Mentioned a 3D icon website that could be used for visual elements in the project.

Milana Gorobchenko:
- Mentioned that the TA approved the use of p5.js for a whiteboard system if needed.
- Presented the initial design based on the Miro board, highlighting features like the calendar widget, journal system, goal system, and character (egg) growth concept.
- Suggested the sticky notes feature for the journal to make it dynamic and visually engaging.
- Discussed the need for an auto-complete feature for labels and a search option in the journal entry page.
- Agreed to adjust the design based on feedback and update the Miro board.
- Will set up a markdown file to outline MVP features and their interactions.

Riana Ali:
- Emphasized the need for clear, concrete definitions of each feature and their interactions.
- Suggested focusing on the MVP and then building additional features if time allows.
- Highlighted the importance of clarifying what each feature will do in detail, including the reward system.

Ginger Smith:
- Raised questions about the navigation between journal and calendar.
- Suggested having the calendar view side-by-side with the journal entry page for better user experience.
- Proposed linking goals to journal entries, allowing users to connect their daily tasks with their larger goals, such as linking an entry about "Applying to five jobs" to a goal of "Getting a job."

Nikolas Yanek-chrones:
- Supported merging the journal and calendar views.
- Suggested a system similar to GitHub issues where goals can be tagged and tracked within journal entries.
- Suggested using interactive animations throughout the app.
- Proposed having a draggable column for the calendar that can be resized as needed.
- Suggested using a hashtag system to link journal entries to specific goals.

Brandon Panuco:
- Suggested that clicking the egg should navigate the user to the inventory page.
- Proposed an inventory system for hatched characters, potentially with rarity levels (common, rare, epic).
- Proposed having each character with different growth stages, allowing the user to see their progress.
- Suggested implementing a system where users can collect different characters based on their interactions with the app.

Charlie Trinh:
- Recommended a notification system to remind users of their daily and weekly goals upon logging in.
- Proposed having pop-ups for these reminders, such as "Eat a banana" for daily goals and "Finish final project" for weekly goals.

Allison Lane:
- Supported clickable day numbers in the calendar view to directly access journal entries.
- Suggested having the current day highlighted in the calendar when in journal view.
