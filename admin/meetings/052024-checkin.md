# General Notes
Issues we're each going to work on:
- Nik made character class, asked for someone to look at the JSdocs workflow to get it to work
   - when editing it's not overwriting what's in the docs folder
   - Character backend docs: https://cse110-sp24-group19.github.io/final-project/Character.html
- Ginger: html of goal setting, links on home page
- Allison goal setting page functionality: edit/delete/add tasks, can also do CSS design for the page - we'll make a new issue
- Charlie: notification systems: daily, weekly, longterm reminders, can help with back end
- Julio: calendar view with sticky notes, will wait for Nik to be done with the design
- Brandon: journal entry search function and labels
- David: labels
- Julie: will work on design of start page, can take screenshot and put it in the readme file to put in the video for Wednesday
- Mark: search feature with Brandon, creating characters with Nik
- Milana: html, backend, can help with anything left
- Riana: puppeteer testing, videos-extra credit - our process - similar to what we did during the warmup
   - Milana do video of issues
   - Someone do a screen record or Miro board
   - Protection rule - Nik added

## Decisions
- Pages of app: work journal and calendar together or separate
- Calendar view: each day is a sticky note
   - for search the ones that don't match disappear
   - shows date and note titles
   - more grayscale notes for unfilled days
   - clarify if previous months also show up in search
- Start page: maybe a functional start page: combine the visually fun start page with the home page, shoutout to Julie for the super cool designs! maybe start page, main page, home page all as one,
   - we want things to be user friendly, have labels so it's usable for first time users
   - functionality in terms of navigation
