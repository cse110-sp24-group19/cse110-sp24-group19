   - sprints and how weâ€™re going to split up tasks between them

## Decisions
- Pages of app: work journal and calendar together or separate
- Calendar view: each day is a sticky note
   - for search the ones that don't match disappear
   - shows date and note titles
   - more grayscale notes for unfilled days
   - clarify if previous months also show up in search
