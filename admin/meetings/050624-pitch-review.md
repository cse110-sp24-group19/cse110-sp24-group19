## Agenda:
1. Getting on the same page about our pitch
     - Looked at pitch doc together
     - Round robin thoughts
     - Julie: companion character that goes with gamification
     - Milana: can use cookies rather than a sign in for making the companion character work
     - Charlie: wanted to know about integrations
     - Nik: integrations could be like github, has used google oauth login but github may be more complicated like using a token
     - Allison: playful and fun goes with our branding, reward system can feel manipulative
     - Julio: notes are on the doc
     - Brandon: when add a new journal entry could have an option for a quick entry - ex. automatically puts the date and add a note, press an icon - convenient tool
     - Milana: could have autopopulated fields like the date and default labels
     - Riana: ground in audience, will ask Kashish about integrations
     - Nik: be mindful about visual elements - tend to take the longest based on experience
     - David: notes from Thursday are represented here
