      |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | **Scope and Targeting**   | Focus may be narrowed to specific dev fields like Physical Oceanographers, Database Admin, or Package Management, though there's a risk if project requirements push for a broader scope.                                                                                                                    |
      | **Competitors Insights**  | Appreciation for Obsidian's markdown support for easy navigation and integration. Comparisons between Obsidian's file system and Agenda's time-based organization suggest a need to choose one due to time constraints. Geekbot’s automated Q&A and GitHub integration are noted as useful features.         |
      | **Design Preferences**    | Preference for a dark theme initially, with a minimalistic and columnar layout that allows for interactive visual elements.                                                                                                                                                                                |
      | **Minimalistic Design**   | Proposes using the notes themselves as the main UI elements for interaction and customization, such as linking to dates or auto-populating commit logs. Warns against oversimplifying to the extent of becoming just a basic text editor.                                                                   |
      | **Strategic Considerations** | Discusses potential integration with platforms like Slack for enhanced usability. Emphasizes the need for a functional journal that doesn't rely overly on external integrations.                                                                                                                            |

  4. Mark:
      | Stage                | Description                                                                                                           |
      |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

  6. Brandon:

      |-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | **Simplicity**          | The UI should remain simple and clean, limiting interactive options to maintain focus, similar to Penzu's interface.       |
      | **Customization**       | Allow customization in each journal entry, such as background colors, images, and custom templates to match writing styles. |
      | **Text Options**        | Support different font styles like Roboto and Times New Roman. Include options for text modification such as highlight and bold. Essential editing icons should be clearly accessible.|
      | **Visual Organization** | Entries should include optional images or visual cues for quick understanding. Use strong color labels for quick identification.|
      | **Section Division**    | Divide the journal into sections such as Entries, Calendar, and Daily Mood. Enhance with sorting/filtering capabilities and improve upon Notion's simple design with colors and custom icons.|
