## Agenda:
1. No old business
2. What we contributed to project
   1. Julie: Mainly wrote CSS. Wanted to add light and dark mode options but couldnâ€™t due to limited time. Tried to keep it simple.
   2. Charlie: Helped Julio with the logic behind how we could make the calendar stay within a 7x5 grid. Worked on the dates loop to keep dates in line. Helped with the Miro board.
   3. Allison: Worked on demo video.
   4. Ginger: Helped with sketching out a potential design. Helped to record part of the demo for going over the Miro board and going over the brainstorm process.
   5. Nik: Contributed to Miro board and part of video.
   6. Brandon: Did some html, tried to make it as clean as possible for Julie.
   7. Riana: Setup meetings and delegated tasks for the project, did code review and organized the github. Wrote a user manual and readme.
   8. Mark: Provided idea on design and did the video. Has another idea for our future project: we can use our team logo as the logo for our app.
   9. David: Worked on date buttons and being able to click on the date and go back from that screen.
