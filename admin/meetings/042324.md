## Agenda:
1. Discussed content that was covered on monday's meeting (Talked about using a calendar like template)
2. Further discussed how the calendar should be formatted (either clicking the date on the calendar and bringing us to another page or using popups so we can insert the event)
3. Talking more indepth about creating the calendar widget and how we go about it.
4. Delegating tasks for creating and designing the widgets.

## Decisions
Any decisions made & their reasoning (if there were dissenting opinions include them, then write why the group decided to make that decision anyways)

For the dayview, decided how the data within the dayview would populate the page. (we decided this because we had to decide whether to have a different page for each dayview or using a single page for the dayview but each day would populate the page.)

Include who, what, when it's due
- [ ] Task 1: Creating how the calender would be formatted, Charlie, Julio, Milana
