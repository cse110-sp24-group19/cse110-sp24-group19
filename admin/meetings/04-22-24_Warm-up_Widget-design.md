## General notes
Links: [Canvas Assignment](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/54609/assignments/778826) [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKSXl2mU=/) 
MVP (Minimum Viable Project)

Shareout (round robin) of what we put on the Miro board:
- Allison: circular sentiment widget
- Nik: Calendar design - since it's a workbook we won't be concerned about what's happening in the future. Care about which day things happened, rather than when in the day. Read only - more about viewing what's in the workbook rather than adding through the calendar. Ex. based on things you did in Github - pulled from another source. Essentially a search widget for when things happened.
    - adding a **search bar** - search for items or dates
    - adding a **view by day, month, and year**
    - design: removing the large buffer
    - adding meaning to the event colors - opacity scaled based on significance: more transparent color = less significant, darker color = more significant
    - only using primary colors at first - not to mix up hues with significance
    - weighting text for day/month/year & significance
    - inspired by Obsidian - note taking app that helps you take ideas
